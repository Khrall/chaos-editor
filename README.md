# chaos-editor

Note: This package does not yet have a stable release.

The Chaos Editor is a robust editor for javascript front-end use. Additional flexibility is planned for this package, so that it can be used with vanilla javascript, jQuery and AngularJS.

## Installation
The package is registered at npm
`npm install chaos-editor`

and in the bower registries
`bower install chaos-editor`

## Usage
Note: The implementation will probably change in the near future.
Include the package and assign an article-tag with the id `article`. The script binds on the document and allows you to write to the article.

Examples can be found in the  [examples](https://github.com/Khrall/chaos-editor/tree/master/example) folder.
